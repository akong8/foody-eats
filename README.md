# Foody Eats

CPSC 304 Group Project

**Summary of our Project**

Our project focuses on the food delivery service industry where the interactions between restaurants, customers, and delivery drivers are crucial in order to ensure that the orders are successful which will be reflected through the orderâ€™s current status. Our database aims to keep track of orders that are made to restaurants from customers. Orders can be classified as either pickup or delivery, which will determine whether a delivery driver is needed.
